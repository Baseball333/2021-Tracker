# 2021-Tracker
A tracker for my 2021 reading/writing output. This repository functions mostly like a management system.

First Commit:
My primary 2021 resolution is to read more literature(across all intellectual interests) and produce more output. I'll explain this more in the later morning. Happy 2021!

Second Commit:
In 2021 I have decided to read more literature, specifically scientific/artistic works of academic non-fiction and general interest. For example my first book of the year is "the Copernican Revolution", written by Thomas S. Kuhn and others at Harvard College. My primary objective is to complete the 278 pages of content in the first week of January 2021 by reading 40 pages for six days and 38 on the last day. Annotations are also included in an external notebook. A description of annotations is described in the next commit.

Third Commit:
As with every literary composition I have read in the past year, I feel the need to include my inquiries in my progression of the work. In this instance, I have decided to highlight subjectively important details in the physical text(concurrently in a separate text).

Fourth Commit:
Remember when I said this repository functions mostly like a management system? Well that statement is partially true. As of late December I have decided to not include any code (or even automation) in this system and rely solely on my own engineering potential. I am sure I can devise an orderly, efficient process of recording each week's progress for 52 weeks without writing anything technical. As such, each file in this repository is the weekly report in regards to my progress. Finally, a separate repository will be created to measure my creative output(again with any sort of programming). Happy reading(I'll commit to the README in the future to explain any ambiguous technicalities.

Fifth Commit:
A note on January 3, 2021 is that I have failed to read my forty pages. As a successive plan I will read twenty pages as I arise on the next day, twenty other pages at midday. The required forty pages will be written at 3:00 and 5:00 respectively. This will greatly aid in my progression of "the Copernican Revolution".

Sixth Commit: Week 1
This is my entry for the first week's revision of this initiative. The book went well and I was able to complete it on time. I am yet to complete the vocabulary required as well as the geometric diagrams required by "the Copernican Revolution"'s comprehension. I was also unable to complete the required page limit each day in respect to maintaining order. One of my improvements in the next week will be to complete the required page limit to not fall behind on any responsibility.

Seventh Commit:
An update; I have written a political manuscript and have begun to read Plato's "Republic".

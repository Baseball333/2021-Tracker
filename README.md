# 2021-Tracker
A tracker for my 2021 reading/writing output. Works mostly like a management system.

First Commit:
My primary 2021 resolution is to read more literature(across all intellectual interests) and produce more output. I'll explain this more in the later morning. Happy 2021!

Second Commit:
In 2021 I have decided to read more literature, specifically scientific/artistic works of academic non-fiction and general interest. For example my first book of the year is "the Copernican Revolution", written by Thomas S. Kuhn and others at Harvard College. My primary objective is to complete the 278 pages of content in the first week of January 2021 by reading 40 pages for six days and 38 on the last day. Annotations are also included in an external notebook. A description of annotations is described in the next commit.
